## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the unique texting habits of my partner and me. I have a tendency to communicate in a more natural, conversational style, while my partner is a more frequent texter who follows traditional texting norms. This occasional mismatch in texting styles has sometimes caused unnecessary worry for my partner. Our application aims to alleviate those concerns by providing a lighthearted and humorous explanation for any dry or unenthusiastic text responses, particularly when I am driving and respond with automated messages. We hope that this will bring peace of mind to my partner and others who may experience similar anxieties in their texting relationships.

## What it does
Our application allows users to input a screenshot of a text message they received. The AI will then generate a humorous explanation for why they may have received such a message. The response is aimed to lift the spirits of the user. 

## How we built it
The backend of the Web App was created with Python and the framework Flask.
- Tesseract for OCR functionality, as well as Pillow so that the image the user uploads can be read as text.
- OpenAI's API was used to generate the funny responses for stories

The frontend of the Web App was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into involved 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first Web Application that Varsha and I have created. We feel that that fact alone is a big reason to be proud. Though Missed Communications is not entirely functional as of right now, we are still really happy with the progress we've made in a short amount of time. We also learned a lot about Web Dev with this one project alone.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Web Development. We learned a lot of HTML, CSS, Javascript, styling options, how to use emojis with Unicodes and many things like that. We learned how to use the Flask framework and different tools and libraries like Tesseract and Pillow as well as AI and ML integration through the OpenAI API. We also learned a lot about how to integrate front and back end processes. 

## What's next for Missed Communications
We plan on finishing out project and actually making it fully functional in the future! We hope to give a lot of people a good laugh with this!
